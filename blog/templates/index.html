          if something isn't as pretty as it could be, it's because I don't work with typescript daily & I have no front end frameworks here. I use 
          HTMX/Django/Hugo/Bulma CSS to create everything here. I import as very little static on these sites because my home internet speed is slow.

            Everything I produce is open source. Everything is replicable from my <a href="https://github.com/Ditmanson?tab=repositories">github.</a>
            Only thing not included in there is kubernetes secrets. I've considered uploading them with sealedsecrets; however, at the moment I just have 
            too much that needs attending too.
